# About
I am a video games programmer with a particular interest in the _design_ and _construction_ of **game engines**. These endeavours are powered by a _proficiency_ and _passion_ for the **C++** programming language.

# Proficiency

## Languages
![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)

C++ is my go to lanuage. I am familar and comfortable with the Standard Template Library (STL). Additonally, I believe that C++ is the perfect blend of the object oriented and procedural programming paradigms.

![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/c-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white)

While I do not use C as much as C++, I am familiar with its benefits. It's fast, lightweight and robust. Furthermore, I am very proficient in the language, capable of solving almost any problem with the C standard library.
